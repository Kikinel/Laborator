                </p><p>
                    Synopsis:
                    Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where vicious creatures called “ghouls” exist alongside
                    humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their
                    thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as
                    humans and blend in with society.
                    Based on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy,
                    bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is
                    not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls' inhuman
                    world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret
                    life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.

                    Synopsis:
                    A battle is about to begin in Tokyo: the Shaman Fight, a tournament held every five hundred years where
                    shaman—those who can command spirits—confront each other in combat. The victor of this contest becomes the Shaman
                    King and the only one who is able to contact and control the Great Spirit, allowing them to reshape the world as
                    they please through its immense power. During a late night walk, Manta Oyamada runs into his classmate, the carefree
                    You Asakura, who invites him to come stargazing with some friends, who, to Manta's horror, turn out to be ghosts from
                    a local cemetery! However, the knowledge that Manta possesses—a rare sixth sense that allows Manta to see these
                    spirits—endears the boy to You. So when You finds out that his new comrade has been beaten up by a local gang, he
                    decides to avenge him with the help of Amidamaru, a samurai ghost whose tomb was broken by the gang leader. Soon
                    Manta uncovers more about the world of spirits, including the Shaman Fight, in which his new friend You aims to
                    claim victory.

                    whose lack of presence allows him to move around unnoticed. Although Kuroko is neither athletic nor able to score
                    any points, he was a member of Teikou's basketball team, where he played as the "Phantom Sixth Man," who easily
                    passed the ball and assisted his teammates. Kuroko no Basket follows the journey of Seirin's players as they attempt

                </p><p>
                    Synopsis:
                    In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword
                    Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of "NerveGear" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using
                    nothing but their own thoughts. Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on
                    the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad,
                    one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they
                    cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game. In
                    order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others
                    are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse,
                    Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality,
                    fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.
